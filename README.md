# Angular Starter Project

This template should help get you started developing with Angular 13. It includes opinionated configurations for VS Code, ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier and Commitlint with commit hooks.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) + [recommended extensions from workspace](.vscode/extensions.json).

## Project Setup

```sh
# Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
# Then go ahead and install all the dependencies
$ npm install
```

If you need help setting up your local development environment, check out the [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) docs.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Alternatively, run `npm run test:watch` to keep Karma watching for file updates.

Karma expects to be able to open a Chrome instance in local development and a headless instance in CI.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` to run all the linters configured for this project in parallel: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2).
